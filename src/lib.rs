//! An analysis engine for zero-sum games.
//!
//! This crate provides a number of traits that can be used to facilitate the
//! implementation of a zero-sum game, and to allow the analysis thereof.
//!
//! Also provided through the use of optional features are implementations
//! for tic-tac-toe and the game of [tak](http://cheapass.com/tak/).
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This crate is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/zero_sum) and can be
//! used by adding `zero_sum` to the dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! zero_sum = "1.2"
//! ```
//!
//! and add this to your crate root:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate zero_sum;
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! If you want to implement the library, you'll need to include a `#[macro_use]`
//! line before `extern crate zero_sum;`
//!
//! If you want to use one of the implementations provided inside the `zero_sum::impls`
//! module, you'll need to specify the appropriate features in your project's `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [features]
//! default = ["zero_sum/with_tak"]
//! ```
//!
//! for instance, to include the `tak` module.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! The three basic traits are `Ply`, `Resolution`, and `State`.  These form
//! the basic building blocks of any zero-sum game.
//!
//! In order to provide analysis, one must also create an evaluator type with
//! `analysis::Evaluator` that has an associated evaluation type that implements
//! `analysis::Evaluation` (usually a tuple wrapper around a numeric type, i.e.
//! `struct Eval(i32);`).  Finally, implement `analysis::Extrapolatable` on the
//! `State` type.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The provided tic-tac-toe implementation is very simple and a usage example can
//! be found in [examples/tic_tac_toe.rs](https://github.com/cdbfoster/zero_sum/blob/master/examples/tic_tac_toe.rs).
